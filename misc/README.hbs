# WARNING

This project is in **active development** and *is not feature-complete yet*, but is already **mature enough**.
The documentation of this specific implementation is not complete either.

# FutoIn reference implementation

Reference implementation of:
 
    FTN7: FutoIn Invoker Concept
    Version: 1.2
    
Spec: [FTN7: Interface Invoker Concept v1.x](http://specs.futoin.org/final/preview/ftn7_iface_invoker_concept-1.html)

[Web Site](http://futoin.org/)

[FTN3: FutoIn Interface Definition](http://specs.futoin.org/final/preview/ftn3_iface_definition.html).

# About

FutoIn Invoker is a peer which initiates a request - invokes a FutoIn interface method
as described in [FTN3: FutoIn Interface Definition](http://specs.futoin.org/final/preview/ftn3_iface_definition.html).
It is not necessary a client - e.g. server may initiate request for event delivery to client.

The method can be implemented locally or remotely - it is transparent to invoking code.
A similar concept can be found in CORBA and other more heavy request brokers.

Strict FutoIn interface (iface) definition and transport protocol is defined in FTN3 spec mentioned above.
**As it is based on JSON, both client and server can be implemented in a few minutes almost in
any technology.** *However, Invoker and Executor concept provide significant benefits for 
efficiency, reliability and error control.*

**The core of invoker is CCM - Connection and Credentials Manager**.
It has the following advantages:

* A single place to configure & hold sensitive data (like credentials)
* Transparent connection management (no need for special connect/request/response/disconnect logic)
* Efficient use of communications (keep-alive, persistent WebSockets channels,
    channel-based instead of message-based security, etc.)
* Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection - implementations are referenced by 
    static names like "mymodule.some.service" in code. The rest is hidden in CCM configuration.

The primary communication channel is WebSockets. Large raw data upload and download
is also supported through automatic fallback to HTTP(S).

SimpleCCM - a light version without heavy processing of iface definition (ideal for browser)
AdvancedCCM - full featured CCM (extends SimpleCCM)

*Note: Invoker and Executor are platform/technology-neutral concepts. The implementation
is already available in JS and PHP. Hopefully, others are upcoming*


# Installation for Node.js

Command line:
```sh
$ npm install futoin-invoker --save
```

# Installation for Browser

Note: there are the following globals available:

* SimpleCCM - global reference to futoin-invoker.SimpleCCM class
* AdvancedCCM - global reference to futoin-invoker.AdvancedCCM class
* futoin.Invoker - global reference to futoin-invoker module
